            <p class="text"><strong>Office Fun with Glasses:</strong><br>
              I thought the office kitchen saga resolved, to my disappointment. 
              However, I am pleased to report that the sink is back in action. 
              Check back for updates (and maybe a photo).</p>
            <p class="text">Day One: I notice a glass in our tiny office sink, 
              filled with brown, murky water and a brown sediment collecting at 
              the bottom.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Office Fun with Mugs:</strong><br>
              Over a three month period, the following fascinating coffee cup 
              saga unfolded.</p>
            <p class="text">Day One: Visiting employees hold a meeting at an office, 
              drinking coffee and then leaving three used mugs in the sink.</p>
            <p class="text">Day Three: Mugs are now full of diluted coffee, dirty 
              water, and Cup-o-noodle soup.</p>
            <p class="text">Day Five: Mugs, particularly the glass one, seem to 
              be developing white scum on their surface.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 10: Mugs remain in place, liquid is now mostly 
              dirty water and food particles.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 13: Mugs seem to be losing liquid to evaporation, 
              but dirty circle is forming on bottom of the sink around each mug's 
              base.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 20: Liquid levels returned to full, apparently 
              from a tomato based soup or dish.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 22: The mugs, with their liquid, are moved from 
              the sink and lined up on the left of the sink on the counter. Rust 
              circles remain at the bottom of the sink.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 25: The liquid is halfway evaporated, leaving 
              a think patina of nastiness along the inside of the mugs. Particulary 
              disturbing on the glass mug.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 30: Liquid appears to be holding steady at about 
              1/8 of a mug.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 42: Mugs are moved, with their liquids, to the 
              right of the sink and lined up along the wall.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 46: No change.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 55: No change.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 73: No change.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 88: The mugs seem to have moved in and set up 
              housekeeping. I imagine that even if we tried to move or clean them, 
              they have sealed themselves to the counter and made their grime 
              immovable.</p>
            <p class="text">Day 102: Tragically, the mugs were washed, the sink 
              cleaned, and we are now on much tighter discipline in the kitchen. 
              Much more pleasant, but the experiment has been shut down!</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Snow &amp; Ice:<br>
              </strong>Recently, all of Portland carried out a most satisfying 
              experiment involving snow and ice. The storm was supposed to blow 
              into town on Monday afternoon, dumping inches and inches of snow. 
              Businesses closed early and everyone stocked up for the storm of 
              the century. Local TV stations went crazy. The temperature hovered 
              in the teens and low twenties -- cold for Portland! The snow began 
              to fall sometime after midnight, and by 6 am there were inches and 
              inches of very dry snow. Schools closed, governments shut down, 
              buses were slowed, businesses never opened. TV was nothing but storm 
              coverage. And it kept snowing. Wednesday was the same story. Snow. 
              Cold. And then the freezing rain showed. Still below freezing, the 
              snow and ice stacked up. The weird roof of the YMCA Pool collapsed. 
              People fell. Idiots drove while talking on their cell phones. Snow 
              plows labored. People forgot to shovel their sidewalks. Parties 
              were thrown. And then it began to melt. But slowly, so there was 
              no flooding. Two weeks later, piles of dirty snow still hide in 
              corners, but mostly there are only fond memories of the slow week 
              in Portland. And 40s and rain never looked so good!</p>

              Hairy Animals:</strong><br>
              Look at Erica is conducting her experiment with a wombat. We should 
              all be inspired by her example and begin developing intense and 
              meaningful relationship with hairy creatures. The following questions 
              should then be asked: 1) Are you happier? 2) Do you have hairballs? 
              3) If so, what did the doctor say? 4) Are you more in touch with 
              your feelings? 5) Does the hairy animal care? <br>

            <p class="text"><strong>Ancient Fridge Food:</strong><br>
              Ben&#8217;s Blueberries, our experiment on blueberries living in
              a fridge inside tupperware, have been destroyed. There is much mourning
              in the scientific community. He replaced them with a tuna-noodle-mushroom
              soup casserole, which was an interesting grey substance. This, too,
              was destroyed. I conducted an intriguing experiment with cilantro
              inside a plastic bag inside a fridge. Cilantro liquifies and turns
              brown after 3 weeks, and I grew scared.</p>
