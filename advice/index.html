              for you</span></p>
            <p class="text">Email your questions: <a href="mailto:cat@bluesweatshirt.com">cat@bluesweatshirt.com</a></p>
            <p class="text">Q: Can I sleep too much?<br>
              A: If your head starts hurting, but you keep forcing yourself back 
              to sleep, you probably ought to just get up. And if you keep dreaming 
              about peeing in the bed, you probably ought to get up to go to the 
              bathroom. Otherwise, the more the better.</p>
            <p class="text">Q: Am I slothful?<br>
              A: No.</p>
            <p class="text">Q: Shouldn't you update bHs more often? What's your 
              problem? <br>
              A: Yes. I'm lazy. I would rather read about Motley Crue in &quot;The 
              Dirt&quot; that write to you.<br>
              Q: That's not very nice.<br>
              A: No. But &quot;The Dirt&quot; is very funny and gross. And you 
              didn't ask a question. Now you will be thrown to the blubbery earth 
              worm who will eat you and turn you into dirt. Ha!</p>
            <p class="text">Q: Is it funny when I choke on food and then cough 
              it out with such force that the food is fired across the room?<br>
              A: Only if you hit someone with the food material, preferably a 
              family member.</p>
            <p class="text">Q: Is it funny when someone else chokes on food and 
              then coughs it out with such force that the food is fired across 
              the room?<br>
              A: Yes, if they are not permanently hurt. If they manage to hit 
              you, it is particularly funny.</p>
            <p class="text">Q: Should I leave the country? At least semi-permanently?<br>
              A: No. You should stay here and not abandon your beautiful country 
              to misguided elected officials. Instead, you should take a cultural 
              exchange outside of your comfortable city and listen to people for 
              the next two years. Just listen. To lots of different people. Don't 
              tell them they're wrong or live in a suburban wasteland, &quot;fly-over 
              country&quot; or even Jesus Land. Feel free to welcome them into 
              your home and invite them to listen to you for a while. Then see 
              what you think about the divide. If you still want to, you may leave 
              the country at that point. But only then. So there.</p>
            <p class="text">Q: Why is my head so small?<br>
              A: Because you are the lost descendent of the little people from 
              the South Pacific. Flores, isn't it? I'm pretty sure. You're parents 
              always said you were adopted, right?</p>
            <p class="text">Q: Is it ever okay for me to be mean? <br>
              A: It all depends on whether you have sent the appropriate prayers 
              to Saint Hector, patron saint of the mean. I created a small altar 
              to him I could worship while sitting on the toilet. Now I can be 
              mean with a safe conscience. If you're having troubles locating 
              Saint Hector, I would be happy to provide you with some clues for 
              a small fee.</p>
            <p class="text">Q: Is my thong underwear sticking out my pants sexy 
              and attractive?<br>
              A: Probably not. It's a 'whale's tail,' and most likely a fashion 
              that will make you squirm in five years. Plus, it's an invitation 
              for a super-wedgy. Consider yourself warned...</p>
            <p class="text">Q: What are you supposed to wear to weddings as a 
              woman?<br>
              A: I have no idea. Something not too skimpy or close to a wedding 
              dress. But is black okay or too dour? What about red? Does that 
              paint you as a harlot.<br>
              Q: Some answer that is! How'd you get to be the &quot;A&quot;?</p>
            <p class="text"> <br>
              Q: How do you find out where people are registered for gifts?<br>
              A: As far as I know, they are supposed to discretely tell you. I'd 
              like to let everyone know that I intend to be permanently registered 
              at Moonstruck Chocolates.</p>
            <p class="text"><strong>Bad, bad Poetry</strong><br>
              Q: When can I share my really bad poetry?<br>
              A: Not here.<br>
              Q: What if I just start reciting it right now?<br>
              A: I&#8217;ll cry.<br>
              Q: Okay, I hope you have a hanky.</p>

            <p class="text">Q: Are you crying yet? I have another.<br>
              A: Maybe later.</p>
            <p class="text"> Is it ever acceptable to pick your nose?<br>
              No, not really. I suggest you make not picking your nose a New Year 
              Resolution. If you must pick your nose, do it in private and hope 
              that no one is using a webcam. BTW, your car is not &quot;private.&quot;</p>
            <p class="text">Does New Year Resolution have to be capitalized? And 
              should there be a possessive?<br>
              Yes. No.</p>
            <p class="text">Can I drive and talk on the cell phone at the same
              time?<br>
              Bad idea. If it's snowed, even badder. Just dumb. Stop it, now.</p>
            <p class="text">Can I ever pee in the shower?<br>
              Only if you are the only person to ever use the shower. If others
              use the shower, you'd better not pee in it. If others are using
              the shower at the same time, you'd really better not pee. If you
              slip up and some pee slips out, don't tell anyone.</p>
            <p class="text">Can I put my indoor cat outside in the snow?<br>
              Yes, if you are mean. I am. But now the cat knows can identify that
              white fluffy stuff -- evil cold, eh? But you should let him back
              inside right away. Definitely.</p>
            <p><span class="text">Do you tip for take out food?<br>
              &#8220;If it&#8217;s delivered, yes. If just picked up, no. The
              point of picking it up is that I walked my sorry ass there to save
              on having to tip the delivery person. If I want to tip, I&#8217;ll
              ask them to bring it to me. But if they bring it when it&#8217;s
              raining, I&#8217;ll tip more.&#8221; (Erica Poff &#8211; EP) </span>

            <p class="text">When is a hooded sweatshirt an appropriate fashion
              choice?<br>
              Saturday mornings buying coffee<br>
              Protests<br>
              When it&#8217;s raining<br>
              When you need a light weight jacket but are not wearing dress clothes.
              The hooded sweatshirt can&#8217;t go with dress clothes. You should
              never see a hooded sweatshirt and a tie together. But you do. And
              those people are wrong (EP).</p>
            <p class="text">Is it ever acceptable to end a relationship via email?
              <br>
              No. Although if it&#8217;s either never contacting the person again
              or sending an email, you&#8217;re a slightly smaller ass if send
              an email. And instant messaging is worse than email, particularly
              if you immediately go offline after sending the message. A text
              message on a phone is even further appalling. &#8220;Correct.&#8221;
              (EP)</p>
            <p class="text">If people really dance stark naked in Portland &#8220;cabarets,&#8221;
              where does the money get stuck for a &#8220;special dance&#8221;
              or a general tip?<br>
              From my experience with g-strings (vast that it is), it&#8217;s
              a handy money holder. My mind wanders to unlikely solutions for
              this dilemma. Upon further discussion with Poff, we&#8217;ve determined
              that in the movies they sometimes pile on the stage or stick it
              in a garter. But if using a garter, are they truly naked? Let&#8217;s
              demand our money back.</p>
            <p class="text">Which reminds us of the throwing of the bouquet and
              removal and toss of garter. Do people find this fun?<br>
              Because at the last wedding I went to, it looked like public humiliation
              for every unmarried person at the wedding. Does make the married
              people feel better that they don&#8217;t have to go down there?
              And what&#8217;s with all the single guys who revel in a seven-year-old
              boy catching the garter? This event should be changed.</p>
            <p class="text">Staring into someone&#8217;s window qualifies as being
              a &#8220;peeping tom&#8221; and is illegal, but what about staring
              at people walking by on the street. When is that an invasion of
              privacy? Is it ever illegal?</p>
            <p class="text">This is some general advice, paraphrased from Erica
              Poff.<br>
              For all of us in our late twenties and beyond who are appalled by
              the twenty-five year old with the published book, international
              interviews, starring movie roles, or company going public, we need
              to remember some important things. First, they&#8217;ve already
              peaked. Where do they go now? What will happen when they&#8217;re
              45? For most of them, there&#8217;s nothing for disappointment waiting
              for them. Second, we&#8217;re taking our own path, which is building
              on itself. All of our odd little jobs are adding up to an amazing
              collection of experiences. And our jobs and projects keep getting
              better and more interesting and more satisfying. We&#8217;re taking
              the pace that can be sustained for pleasurable professional development.
              Third, we&#8217;re rockin&#8217; human beings, and nothing can change
              that.</p>
